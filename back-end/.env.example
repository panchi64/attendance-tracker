# Example Environment Variables for Attendance Tracker

# --- Database Configuration ---
# Specifies the SQLite database file.
# The path should be relative to where the backend executable is run.
# For development, if running `cargo run` from the `back-end` directory,
# this would typically point to a file within `back-end` or a subdirectory.
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:attendance_tracker.db

# --- Server Configuration ---
# Host the server will bind to.
# Use 0.0.0.0 to listen on all available network interfaces,
# or 127.0.0.1 for localhost only.
SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0

# Port the server will listen on.
SERVER_PORT=8080

# --- Frontend Configuration ---
# Path to the built frontend static files, relative to the backend executable.
# If using the `run_full_app.sh` script, this script sets it to
# `../back-end/static_frontend` (assuming backend is run from `back-end/target/release` or `back-end/target/debug`).
# If you run the backend directly from the `back-end` workspace directory (e.g., `cargo run`),
# and your script places the frontend in `back-end/static_frontend`,
# then `static_frontend` would be appropriate.
# Adjust if your deployment structure is different.
FRONTEND_BUILD_PATH=./static_frontend

# --- Application Logic ---
# Duration (in seconds) for which a generated confirmation code is valid.
# Example: 300 seconds = 5 minutes
CONFIRMATION_CODE_DURATION_SECONDS="300"

# --- Logging ---
# Controls the log level for the application.
# Format: RUST_LOG="[target=level][,target=level...]"
# Examples:
# RUST_LOG="info" (default info level for all targets)
# RUST_LOG="attendance_tracker=debug,actix_web=info" (debug for app, info for actix_web)
RUST_LOG="info,attendance_tracker=debug"

# --- Optional: Base URL ---
# If the application is served behind a reverse proxy under a specific path,
# set this to the full public base URL.
# This helps in generating correct absolute URLs if needed (e.g., for QR codes if they were absolute).
# Example: BASE_URL="https://yourdomain.com/attendance"
# If running locally and directly, it might be:
# BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080"
# Leave commented out or empty if not needed or if relative paths are always used.
# BASE_URL=""
